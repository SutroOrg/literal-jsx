_Let JSX embrace its potential as a content authoring markup format for the component-based era!_

**Literal JSX** is a lightweight format for content potentially rich in data and nominal structure.
It extends [JSON](https://json.org/) by adding the JSX-like _Element_ type as a possible value type aside objects,
 arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, and `null`. However, instead of the full JavaScript expression syntax,
 only JSON data (through possibly nesting more _Element_ nodes recursively) are allowed inside of its attributes
 ("props") and children.
